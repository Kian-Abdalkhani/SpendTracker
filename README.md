# SpendTracker

Welcome to SpendTracker, this is a personal project of mine to manage all of my bank account balances without having to pay for pricy subscription services. I believe that everyone should have access to easier budgeting/spending trackers to improve our lives financially.

This project utilizes the free version of the Plaid API to securely link to financial institutions and use that information to create a one-stop-shop with all your bank accounts and balances in one place.
